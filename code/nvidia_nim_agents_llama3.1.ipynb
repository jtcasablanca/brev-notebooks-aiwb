    "This notebook will use a [NVIDIA Llama 3.1 NIM](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/supercharging-llama-3-1-across-nvidia-platforms/) with tool-calling agent capabilities in generative AI solutions. As mentioned in this [Introductory Blog on LLM Agents](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-to-llm-agents/), agents can be described as AI systems that use LLMs to reason through a problem, create a plan to solve the problem, execute the plan with the help of a set of tools, and use memory to store meaningful context of the system state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is designed to provide an intro to merely one of the capabilities of agent systems: **tool calling**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** are interfaces that accept input, execute an action, and then return a result of that action in a structured output according to a pre-defined schema. They often encompass external API calls that the agent can use to perform tasks that go beyond the capabilities of the LLM, but do not have to be external API calls. For example, to get the current weather in San Diego, a weather tool might be used. Or to get the current score of the 49ers game, a generic web search tool or ESPN tool might be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is NVIDIA NIM and How do They Support Tool Calling for Agents?\n",
    "### What is NIM?\n",
    "NIM supports models across domains like chat, embedding, and re-ranking models \n",
    "from the community as well as NVIDIA. These models are optimized by NVIDIA to deliver the best performance on NVIDIA \n",
    "accelerated infrastructure and deployed as a NIM, an easy-to-use, prebuilt containers that deploy anywhere using a single \n",
    "command on NVIDIA accelerated infrastructure. If you're new to NIMs with LangChain, check out the [documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/providers/nvidia/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, NIMs support tool calling, also known as \"function calling\" for models that have the aforementioned capability. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate a model that supports function calling, [Llama 3.1 8b-instruct](https://build.nvidia.com/meta/llama-3_1-8b-instruct). \n",
    "\n",
    "### What does it mean for NIM to support tool usage?\n",
    "In order to support tool usage in an agent workflow, first an LLM must be trained to detect when a function should be called and output a structured response like JSON that contains the function to be called and its arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the model is packaged as a NIM, meaning it's optimized to deliver best performance on NVIDIA accelerated infrastructure and easy to deploy as well as use. This microservice packaging also uses OpenAI compatible APIs, so developers can build world-class generative AI agents with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how to use tools in a couple of examples."
